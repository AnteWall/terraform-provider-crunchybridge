# Crunchy Bridge Terraform Provider

This repository contains the implementation of the [Crunchy Bridge Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CrunchyData/crunchybridge/latest)

[Usage documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CrunchyData/crunchybridge/latest/docs) can be found on the Terraform registry as well.

For additional Crunchy Bridge documentation, see the [Crunchy Bridge documentation site](https://docs.crunchybridge.com)

## Developer notes

The `/docs` directory is generated by `go generate` - don't place files there directly, use the `/template` directory instead (or watch your hard work get unceremoniously deleted).
